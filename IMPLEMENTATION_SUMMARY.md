# TBA Post Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **TBAPostModal Component** (`src/components/TBAPostModal.tsx`)

A fully functional modal form with:

- **Beautiful UI Design**:
  - Gradient header (purple to pink theme)
  - Smooth animations with Framer Motion
  - Responsive layout
  - Real-time image preview

- **Form Fields** (as requested):
  - ✅ **Header** - Text input for post headline
  - ✅ **Description** - Textarea for post content
  - ✅ **Image** - URL input with live preview
  - ✅ **Image Header** - Text for image card title
  - ✅ **Image Description** - Textarea for image details

- **Features**:
  - Form validation (all fields required)
  - Loading states during submission
  - Error handling
  - Clean, modern design matching BaseTime aesthetic
  - Accessible form controls with proper labels

### 2. **CalendarView Integration** (`src/components/CalendarView.tsx`)

Updated to integrate the TBA modal:

- Added state management for TBA modal
- Connected "Schedule TBA Post" button to open the form
- Created `handleTBASubmit` function to process form data
- Proper modal flow (DayAction → TBA Modal)

### 3. **Data Structure**

Created TypeScript interface for type safety:

```typescript
interface TBAPostData {
  header: string;
  description: string;
  image: string;
  imageHeader: string;
  imageDescription: string;
}
```

### 4. **Documentation**

Created comprehensive documentation:

- **TBA_POST_FEATURE.md**: Complete feature documentation
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: This file
- Includes next steps for actual posting implementation
- Code examples for smart contract integration

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Navigate to Calendar View**
2. **Click any date** in the calendar
3. **Select "Schedule TBA Post"** from the day action modal
4. **Fill out the form**:
   - Enter a catchy header
   - Write a detailed description
   - Add an image URL (with live preview)
   - Add image header and description
5. **Click "Schedule Post"**
6. **Check console** for the payload structure

## 📊 Current Status

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| UI/UX Design | ✅ Complete |
| Form Fields | ✅ Complete (all 5 fields) |
| Form Validation | ✅ Complete |
| Image Preview | ✅ Complete |
| Data Collection | ✅ Complete |

## 🔧 What's Next

To complete the feature and enable actual posting to Base social feed:

### Step 1: Research Base Social Contract
- Find the contract address for Base social posts
- Obtain the contract ABI
- Understand the function signatures

### Step 2: Implement Contract Interaction
```typescript
// Add to src/hooks/useTBAPost.ts
import { useWriteContract } from 'wagmi';

export function useTBAPost() {
  const { writeContract, data: hash } = useWriteContract();
  
  const createPost = async (data: TBAPostData) => {
    // Encode data according to Base protocol
    const castData = encodeCastData(data);
    
    // Call contract
    writeContract({
      address: SOCIAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      abi: SOCIAL_CONTRACT_ABI,
      functionName: 'publishCast',
      args: [castData],
    });
  };
  
  return { createPost, hash };
}
```

### Step 3: Update CalendarView Handler
Replace the placeholder in `handleTBASubmit` with actual contract call.

### Step 4: Add Transaction Status UI
Show loading, success, and error states to users.

2. **Implement smart contract integration** (see Step 2 above)
3. **Test on Base testnet** first
4. **Add error handling** for failed transactions
5. **Add success notifications** to users
6. **Deploy to production**

## 🎉 Summary

The TBA Post feature is now **fully functional** from a UI/UX perspective. Users can:

✅ Click any date in the calendar  
✅ Access the TBA post form  
✅ Fill out all required fields  
✅ See image previews  
✅ Submit the form  

The next step is to implement the actual posting to Base social feed by integrating with the Base social contract. The foundation is solid and ready for that integration.
